            That sounds like an inexpensive way to fill your blog space. However, there’s a big difference between posting content and making your blog a successful marketing tool. We provide custom content that helps build bonds between you and your current and future customers. Our content shows the uniqueness of your offerings and is designed to encourage your customers to engage with you. Generic content can’t do that.

            Web hosting is a service that stores and delivers the files for your blog from a web server. When people visit your domain name the web hosting company delivers your blog files from their web server to the visitor. Every single website needs to have web hosting in order to function, and a high-quality web host is very important if you want your blog to function correctly.  In my tutorial I show you how to find high-quality web hosting at a very affordable price.

            A blog is simply a type of website. Blogs use blog software in order to make designing, writing, and publishing your content as simple and professional as possible.Blogs can be customized to do just about anything, but most blogs tend to offer fresh content on a weekly basis along with the ability for readers to leave comments.  These are not requirements however, as many large established sites (Bestbuy.com, Xerox.com, Time.com, etc.) use the WordPress blog software to create things that look nothing like traditional blogs.
